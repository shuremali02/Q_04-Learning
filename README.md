# 🧠 AI & Python Learning Tasks

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through three major topics: **Generative AI**, **FastAPI**, and **Pydantic**. These tasks were part of a structured learning program under my instructor's guidance, and I’ve completed each with code, practical testing, and reflection.

## 📌 1. Generative AI

### ✅ What I Did:
- Learned the basics of Artificial Intelligence and Generative AI.
- Wrote a detailed blog post explaining concepts in simple terms.
- Created example files and pushed them here.

## 📌 2. FastAPI

### ✅ What I Did:
- Read and understood the FastAPI tutorial from Panaverse’s repo.
- Ran the code locally and understood each line of it.
- Documented code and examples.

## 📌 3. Pydantic

### ✅ What I Did:
- Learned how to use Pydantic for data validation in Python.
- Practiced the concepts using examples.
- Tested validation scenarios locally.

🔗 **GitHub Folder**: [`03Pydantic`](./03Pydantic)  
📖 **Reference**: [Pydantic Validation - Panaverse](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/blob/main/04_daca_agent_native_dev/01_intro_fastapi/02_pydantic_validation/readme.md)

# 🧠 AI & Python Learning Tasks

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through three major topics: **Generative AI**, **FastAPI**, and **Pydantic**. These tasks were part of a structured learning program under my instructor's guidance, and I’ve completed each with code, practical testing, and reflection.

---

## 📌 1. Generative AI

### ✅ What I Did:
- Learned the basics of Artificial Intelligence and Generative AI.
- Wrote a detailed blog post explaining concepts in simple terms.
- Created example files and pushed them here.

## 📌 2. FastAPI

### ✅ What I Did:
- Read and understood the FastAPI tutorial from Panaverse’s repo.
- Ran the code locally and understood each line of it.
- Documented code and examples.

## 📌 3. Pydantic

### ✅ What I Did:
- Learned how to use Pydantic for data validation in Python.
- Practiced the concepts using examples.
- Tested validation scenarios locally.

🔗 **GitHub Folder**: [`03Pydantic`](./03Pydantic)  
📖 **Reference**: [Pydantic Validation - Panaverse](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/blob/main/04_daca_agent_native_dev/01_intro_fastapi/02_pydantic_validation/readme.md)

---
📌 4. FastAPI Parameters
✅ What I Did:
Explored path parameters, query parameters, and request body in FastAPI.

Practiced using Path, Query, and Body from FastAPI.

Learned how to validate incoming data using constraints (like min, max, optional).

Understood how these parameters work together in API routes.

## 🚀 What's Next?

I'm continuing to explore more advanced Python and AI concepts and will keep updating this repo with future tasks and projects.

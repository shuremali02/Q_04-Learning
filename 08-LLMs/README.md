## 🧩 Main Components of an LLM

| Component       | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tokenizer**     | Breaks down input text into smaller units called tokens                   |
| **Embedding Layer** | Converts tokens into numerical vectors for the model                    |
| **Transformer**   | Core engine of the model that understands context and relationships       |
| **Output Layer**  | Converts internal results back into human-readable text                   |
